	/*--------------API TESTING-----------
	 * ApI testing is done at backend testing ---to perform API testing--POSTMAN, RESTASSURED, SOAP UI.
	 * To perform API testing manually we will use POSTMAN , to perform automation we use RESTASSURED.
	 * 
	 * CLIENT: is a computer hardware device or software that accesses a service made available by a server
	 * The server is often(but not always ) located in a separate physical computer.
	 * 
	 * A SERVER : is a physical computer dedicated to run service to serve the needs to other computers. Depending on the service that is running,
	 * it could be file , server, database server, home media server,print server, or web server.
	 * 
	 *Here from where we are sending request is client and where the application is existed,installed is a server.
	 *when u send request with url or any word the server will fetch  web pages regarding dat words or url and then it repsond to the
	 *request sent by the client and display related applications.
	 *through internet both client and servers will communicated each other by browsing.
	 *
	 ----------------CLIENT/SERVER ARCHITECTURE--------
	 
	 *1.1-TIER    2.2-TIER    3.3-TIER (web application)
	 *1. when u dont have any server bt only computer and ur using notepad or excel and saving the data in files in the same system
	 * then this category comes under the 1-TIER , in this we dont have any database or server ,file itself is the server
	 
	 *2.we have multiple clients and one database server  example: multiple bank employes will access their application 
	 *which is maintained in  theier server(this preset in different machine-remote)
	 *
	 *3.CLIENT TIER ,BUSINESS LOGIC(web server or applicatio server) , DATABASE LAYER (database).
	 *multiple clients , there is a some business logic in between client and server when we search any request 
	 *that take from client  and same request is sent to databse  and fetch the data ans again send back to
	 * business logic layer and sent to client.
	 * Here business logic layer and databse layer are 2 present in diffenre machines.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * ------------CLIENT/SERVER ARCHITECTURE-------------------
	 * It has 3 layers 1.presentation layer 2.Application layer 3.Data layer(scripting languages)
	 * 1.presentation  layer is developed by using HTML,JAVA SCRIPT, CSS(programming layer)
	 * 2.Applicatio layer is developed by using java,net,c & python , c++
	 * 3.Data layer is developed by MY SQL, ORACLE,SQL SERVER, MONGODB
	 * 
	 * 
	 * ------------------API----------------
	 * Application programming interface is the way of communicating between two applications while the applications may be
	 * differ in terms of platforms and technology.
	 * when u send the request from the fronted layer ,appplication layer will take the request and send that request to the data base layer
	 * fetch the data and send the respond to the application layer and application layer display that respond to the presentation layer
	 * Here application layer act as a intermediate between the 2 layers 
	 * As a appplication layer is working for application , it contains programming code(business logic) and it act as a intermediate 
	 * between the 2 layers so API is called application programming interface.
	 * when we do appplication testing also the data is fetched from API so testing the API will reduce the time of tetsing application testing
	 * we should not relay completely on api or gui we have to do the both ,bt tetsing API will reduce the tetsing of application .
	 * 
	 * First database layer is developed, api and then finally GUI is developed. Developing GUI is waste because it doesnt 
	 * contain any programming logic
	 * First level of testing is done at APIS only.
