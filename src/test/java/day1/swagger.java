	/*-------------SWAGGER------------------------
	 * SWAGGER---it is basically interactive documentation,it is not a static document
	 * In documnet, itself we can do the testing not completely (bt for exploring)
	 * It contains detailed information of API
	 * It is internally connected with server
	 * we can explore the functionality of the api,bt where as in postman we can generate the reports and we can document it
	 * bt in swagger document we can just check the fucntionality or exploration.
	 * 
	 * FAKERESTAPI.COM---it is a sample of swagger document
	 * 
	 * CURL(CLIENT URL)
	 * ------
	 * In swagger document sometimes the developer gives the CURL instead of URL for the API'S.
	 * instead of providing multiple info they just provide the CURL.
	 * It is only for exploring and not for completely testing, developer will develop SWAGGER document and shares SWAGGER URL by developer
	 * In some documentation, they don't provide request URL directly instead they provide(CURL).
	 * CURL contains the URL along with the information and headers.
	 * u can import the CURL to the postman by clicking the import option and save it will get the URL and send the request.
	 * 
	 * It means CLIENT URL--it contains header information, authentication etc...
	 * It is a consilated string(it consist of all parameters)
	 * It is a command.
	 *--->open postman---->import--->raw text---->paste CURL+enter
	 *From CURL we can sent and get response.
