	 * 
	 * Serilization means converting pojo calss(it is a object of java ) into json format
	 * Deserilization means converting json object to pojo java object (pojo)
	 * 
	 * while we are using pojo object to send data along with request body it trasmits through the network in 
	 * json format and reaches server and gets back response in jsonformat onlt 
	 * But the source and destination will be in java object only .bt  while transmiting through network
	 * pojo converts into jsonformat,because json is a very light weighted data and more secured while
	 * comapred with the java it is a high weighted object
